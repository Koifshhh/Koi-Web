                <p>About Me</p>
                <p>Computer Scientist/Art Historian</p>
                <p>Hello, my name is Armani Rogers. I am a well-rounded recent college grad with a 3.0 GPA, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Art History from Cornell College. During my academic career, I managed to accrue 4 years of work experience on the web team in the Cornell IT department, nearly 2 months of hardware/software work experience as a project manager in my free time over the summer of 2019 with Harper Reed at Harper Rules, LLC, and most recently two summer internships with Wintrust Bank as an IT intern. Through my experiences I learned valuable computer science skills such as application development, database design, IT/IS and digital art. In my time as an Art Historian, I have traveled abroad for studies in Rome and served as a teacherâ€™s assistant and tutor at Cornell. In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised for my attention to detail by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven organizational, teamwork, and analytical skills.</p>
                <p>I am well rounded as a developer and designer. I possess an acute level of attention to detail and sellar organization. If you have any projects that need my skillset, I am more than happy to lend a helping hand to achieve your goals. Feel free to contact me as I am always up for the job. </p>
